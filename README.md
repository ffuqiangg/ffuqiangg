### Hi there 👋

I'm not a software developer, I just learned a little bash scripts and wrote code for my own use. If it works for you, ⭐ please.

🔧 I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [neovim](https://neovim.io/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on `WSL` and `endeavouros`. You and find my vim and neovim config in [dotfiles](https://github.com/ffuqiangg/dotfiles) repostory.

🔭 Some of my repository:
- [Build OpenWrt](https://github.com/ffuqiangg/build_openwrt) (Build OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt/LEDE firmware for Phicomm N1)
- [amlogic s9xxx armbian](https://github.com/ffuqiangg/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) (Compile kernel/armbian for Amlogic s9xxx TV Box)
- [OpenWrt Packit](https://github.com/ffuqiangg/openwrt_packit) (Packit Phicomm N1 OpenWrt firmware)
